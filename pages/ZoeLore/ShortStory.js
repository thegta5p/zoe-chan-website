        <p className="py-2">
          The moment she thought of the cake store, Zoe dove into the air,
          surrendering herself to gravity. While falling, she reached out with
          her consciousness to form a gateway. Instantly, a portal opened
          beneath her and connected to the other place. She fell into the gate.
          Her mass collided and imploded as she traveled.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          <em>It kinda tickles.</em>
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Unfortunately, Zoe did not appear at her intended destination.
          Instead, she emerged from a second portal only a dozen strides away,
          propelled through the air by the momentum of her previous fall. Then,
          after a brief moment of equilibrium, she was pulled back into the
          second portal. Again, time and space twisted around her—all
          swooshy-like, as she would describe it—before flopping her back at the
          starting point. Both portals then folded into space and disappeared.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          A powerful magic was distorting Zoe’s ability to travel. It probably
          related to whatever change she was supposed to herald, and, obviously,
          she hadn’t succeeded yet. It was a problem, but not an unfamiliar one.
          She wasn’t really sure what the message was, who it was for, or even
          what it meant, but, in her experience, those details rarely mattered.
          The holy mathematics wanted to advance, and the messages generally
          fell into place shortly after she arrived. Zoe felt that was a pretty
          cool advantage of being an Aspect.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Of course, there was now the question of what to do while she waited.
          Zoe glanced around. Beside a nearby tree, she spotted a small, fuzzy
          creature with a huge tail. It looked similar to a tiny yordle, though
          Zoe noted how this creature’s connection to the spirit world was
          comparatively miniscule.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          The small animal’s life-pattern flashed in Zoe’s brain. It would live
          only a dozen rotations before returning its spirit. To her, the
          brevity of its life made it more adorable. Zoe jumped up and ran
          toward it.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">“So cute!”</p>
        <p className="py-2">
          The tiny animal scrambled up the tree away from her.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">“Hey, come back!” she pouted</p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Without slowing her pursuit, Zoe created a time bubble, turning it
          only half a planet’s rotation, before launching it at the tree. The
          anomaly bounced before bursting against the tree’s trunk.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          For a second, the cute animal’s past merged with the present. The
          night sky overtook the area, and twilight butterflies pulsed around
          it. The small creature fell into the tired, restful sleep of the
          previous evening, as its past’s spiritual and mental state overwhelmed
          its current consciousness.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Zoe ignored gravity for a moment, floated up into the branches, and
          came to a stop beside the tiny animal. Her hand hesitated above its
          downy fur. She knew the moment she touched the creature, her spell
          would break.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          “Zoe is a friend,” she whispered. But when she caressed the tiny
          animal’s head, it burst awake and dove away from her in a panic.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          With a disappointed moan, Zoe floated a bit higher before flipping
          upside down. She considered visiting Aurelion Sol after she finished
          here. The dragon didn’t like being petted either. But, she thought, he
          was easier to catch without harming. This notion vanished as, thanks
          to her new altitude, Zoe saw past the hills and spotted a village on
          the horizon.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          She willed a portal to the town into existence and dove into it. But,
          again, Zoe was only able to create a gate to a few yards away. Worse,
          it collapsed upon itself, as before, and pulled her back to her
          starting point.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          The summer grass did seem inviting, so with no better option, she
          walked through the forest to the village.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          She arrived at the outskirts of the walled town as the sun began to
          set. Hearing laughter, she dismissed gravity for a second and floated
          up to one of the village’s rooftops.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          In the center courtyard, a half dozen mortals were playing. They were
          almost exactly Zoe’s size, unlike the children or adults she had
          encountered more recently in her tour of the planet.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          One of the males chased a female around in a circle. Both were
          laughing. The rules of the game were unclear.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Zoe focused on the girl’s beautiful red dress—wondering if the
          coloration represented something. Even if it wasn’t a part of the
          game, Zoe liked it. The girl seemed taller than the other females, and
          Zoe felt the girl might know things she needed to learn.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          The male was also interesting, but in a completely different way. She
          could tell his current incarnation would be short lived, but Zoe
          suspected it would be amazing if he chased her. There was something
          wonderful about his chin and the shape of his lips.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          She swallowed nervously. It had, after all, been a very long time
          since Zoe was a mortal or had even visited this realm. She was
          strangely worried the group wouldn’t accept her, and she would be left
          out of whatever they were playing.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Two of the other boys, decidedly less interesting ones, began kicking
          a ball between themselves. This game, Zoe remembered.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Emboldened by this connection, Zoe swooped down from the rooftop to
          the middle of the group.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          “Hi!” she said, while turning the base of her hair into a color that
          mimicked the tall female’s dress.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          “A spirit,” the interesting boy said with wide eyes. Then he screamed,
          “Run!”
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Zoe felt she should point out she was an Aspect rather than a spirit,
          but she was uncertain if his cry was part of the other game’s rules.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          “Actually, I’m here with a message. But if you wanted to play, I have
          plenty of time,” she said, as she launched after them.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Then she flew, as casually as she could, alongside the tall girl.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          “Your red outfit is so cool! Does the color mean something?” Zoe
          asked. But her attempt at starting a conversation hardly mattered. As
          she spoke, the tall girl was pulled into a house by the interesting
          boy. He then slammed the heavy, wooden door shut, blocking Zoe’s path.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Zoe glanced around, discovering the other mortals had similarly
          disappeared, but a commotion could be heard coming from a keep near
          the center of the town.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          After a moment, a dozen men in armor came running toward Zoe with
          spears. They reminded her of Pantheon’s weapon.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">Local guardians, she surmised.</p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Assuming she was a spirit, they screamed warnings, while their leader
          attempted a banishing spell. It was a very good spell, in Zoe’s
          opinion, but not one she wanted. She wondered if, perhaps, spirits
          frequently plagued the town.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          When the men began throwing their weapons at Zoe, she manifested an
          arcane meteor and sent it on a flight path around the keep. Then, the
          twilight girl created a pair of portals to dodge the guardian’s
          spears, before finally redirecting the shooting star at her attackers.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          The meteor’s impact created an implosion, causing a chain reaction
          with the small particles it had gathered while flying, which resulted
          in a secondary explosion that thundered through the guards and their
          tower—annihilating the area into a fine dust.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          “Hello?” Zoe asked as the clouds of destruction whirled around her.
          She wondered if the tall girl or the interesting boy had run away. It
          seemed likely.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Momentarily dispirited, Zoe decided to visit a larger mortal
          settlement next. It seemed like someone might be willing to play with
          her at that sort of location.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          Zoe remembered where a... city had been a few thousand years ago. On
          instinct and despite her previous failures, she willed a portal to it.
          And she was pleasantly surprised when a gateway opened to her intended
          destination
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          “Oh cool!” she said, happy to be able to travel again, and eager to
          deliver her next message.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          As Zoe stepped out of reality, she wondered if the new crater would
          lead some mortals to find the World Rune that was nearby. The tall
          girl or that interesting boy might even be the ones to discover it.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
          It would probably be funny if they did, she decided.
